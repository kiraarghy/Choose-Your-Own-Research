# Choose Your Own Research

## Synopsis

This app was intended as a quick and fun teaching tool at a previous job to teach researchers on the intricacies of regulatory applications. The use of Twine was for initial ease of use and creator familiarity.

The app took you through the process of applying to regulatory bodies for clinical research trials. It would present information, have questions, each question taking you down a slightly modified path. An example of this path would be: 

  Have you applied for research funding? ------Yes------> Do you have NIHR porfolio eligibility? ------Yes-------> And so on
                                       \-------No-------> Funding opportunities -------> Do you want to apply to funding opportunity X?

It also has the ability to save the choices that you made and then output these to a page at the end of the story route. The intent for this was to allow you to then screenshot the information and send to the research delivery team. 
                                                                           
  Output: Wants to apply for funding opportunity x, needs to have regulatory approval y.

This was well received by researchers, and when used cut down on the amount of time the research team had to teach researchers the regulatory approvals pathway. It eventually got put forwards for a National Institute for Health Research continual improvement award.

## Motivation

It shows an innovative use of Twine outside of CYOA type systems I believe it shows the business case for using and developing apps like twine to deliver bespoke training packages where applications like Moodle provide sub-standard results for their high price. 

I took inspiration from Jace Harrâ€™s project: http://philome.la/jace_harr/you-feel-like-shit-an-interactive-self-care-guide/play For myself it taught me a lot about html, some JS, CSS and working around restrictive software requirements (NHS uses IE 6.0.)
