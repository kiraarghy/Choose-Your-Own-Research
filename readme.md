## Synopsis

This project was intended as a quick and fun teaching tool at a previous job to teach researchers on the intricacies of regulatory applications. The use of Twine was for initial ease of use and creator familiarity. 

## Motivation

I believe it shows the business case for using and developing apps like twine to deliver bespoke training packages. It shows an innovative use of Twine outside of CYOA type systems I took inspiration from Jace Harrâ€™s project: http://philome.la/jace_harr/you-feel-like-shit-an-interactive-self-care-guide/play For myself it taught me a lot about html, some JS, CSS and working around restrictive software requirements (NHS uses IE 6.0.) 


Who maintains and contributes to the project? Due to moving on from my previous job it is not currently maintained by anyone. However I hope someone has the time in the future to take this concept further.
